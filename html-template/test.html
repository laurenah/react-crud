								<h2>The Odd One Out</h2>
								<span class='byline'>Aug 28. 2020</span>
							</div>
							<!-- <p><img src="banner.jpg" alt="" class="image image-full" /> </p> -->
							<p>For my last two years of high school, I decided to leave the school I had attended for
								the
								first
								16
								years of my life in order to specialise for the university degree I wanted. This meant
								leaving
								behind most of my friends, but I gained so much more than I expected. The best friend
								who
								I've
								lived
								on the same street as for my entire life was at the school I transferred to. Tuition
								fees
								went
								down
								to around $1,000, which \meant my family could afford to knock down and entirely rebuild
								our
								house
								(with a pool!) instead of only renovating a bathroom. Private school didn't offer nearly
								half as
								many courses as my new school did. Straight away I knew I wanted to sign up for as many
								computer-related courses I could. Software Development (if you could call it that, more
								on
								this
								later) and VET Game Design were my first choices.</p>
							<p>Of course, the Australian Curriculum exists, so I couldn't do every single
								computer-related
								course at
								my disposal. The core units I went with were: English Language, Chemistry, Math Methods.
								My
								other
								picks changed between Year 11 and Year 12. 11: Did Physics. 12: Dropped Physics and Game
								Design
								and
								picked up this funky course made by the University of Melbourne and Monash University
								called
								Algorithmics.</p>
							<p>Okay, now that you know my name and my story, let's get to the title of this post. My
								time in
								VCE
								Software Development was rocky to start. I, along with one other girl, were the only
								females
								in
								this
								class during Year 11. That one girl and I became good friends during our time in this
								class,
								helping
								each other with the exercises and assignments whilst the teacher berated the absolute
								ears
								off
								every
								other person in the class for constantly slacking off (Halo LAN game anyone?) and gave
								thrilling
								100+ page PowerPoint presentations about each learning outcome.</p>
							<p>After Year 11, my only female IT companion decided to drop Software Development so she
								could
								specialise for her passion: Audio Engineering. That made me the only female student in
								Software
								Development. Now, remember from earlier: "If you could call it that, more in this
								later"? In
								Software Development I learned, drumroll please, Microsoft Excel! Tasty Macros and
								Cheese.
								Learning
								the basics of VBA and the Waterfall SDLC was all it was. Of course, nowadays this course
								is
								more
								current, probably more useful to students than it was to me. I wouldn't trade it for the
								world
								though, because it made my final years in high school a pleasure to look back on. Being
								the
								only
								female in the class could've beaten me down, but only made me more motivated (and the
								top
								student in
								the class).</p>
							<p>This experience ultimately gave me more confidence in myself and my abilities, and
								prepared
								me
								for my
								time at university. Thankfully, I was never the only female in my class ever again.
								However,
								the
								balance was still out, and that meant that us girls tended to band together in a single
								assignment
								group. When the tutors picked our groups for us however, I was once again the only
								female in
								the
								group. Normal is boring, be the odd one out.</p>
